                    <br>
                    All first-years at Hogwarts had to take seven core subjects: Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, History of Magic, <br>
                    Defence Against the Dark Arts, Astronomy and Herbology. Flying lessons (on broomsticks) were also <br>
                    compulsory. Flying was the only one of these that could be dropped upon entry into second year. <br>
                    <br>
                    At the end of their second year at Hogwarts, students were required to choose a minimum of two additional <br>
                    subjects from the following list: Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes and Care of <br>
                    Magical Creatures. Students couldn't elect to drop any of the core subjects at this time, but they could <br>
                    choose to drop an elective if it became a burden. <br>
                    <br>
                    During their fifth year, students had an appointment with their Head of <br>
                    House to discuss which job they wanted to go into. The professor would <br>
                    recommend any specific subjects for N.E.W.T. level required for this job, <br>
                    taking into account their predicted O.W.L. grades based on their current <br>
                    performance. The teacher could recommend subjects based on the <br>
                    student's current grades if the student was unsure of what job they would like. These students made <br>
                    provisional choices for N.E.W.T.s at this time and their choices were confirmed or rejected depending on their <br>
                    achieved O.W.L grades or the demand. <br>
                    <br>
                    During sixth year, students advanced to N.E.W.T.-level classes, based on <br>
                    the individual's O.W.L. scores for a certain subject. The professor would <br>
                    decide the O.W.L. grade needed. Course work during this year was much <br>
                    more advanced than it had been previously. The majority of students' time <br>
                    was spent studying and trying to cope with the vast amounts of homework <br>
                    they were being given. Students in the sixth year could also elect to take part in Apparition lessons for a fee of <br>
                    twelve Galleons. <br>
                    <br>
                    The seventh year was the final year of magical education. At the end of the year, students took the exam for <br>
                    their N.E.W.T. subjects that had been chosen in sixth year and carried through to the seventh. <br>
                    <br>
                    Very specialised subjects such as Alchemy were offered in the final two years, but would only be provided if <br>
                    there was sufficient demand. It is unknown whether the student would need any grades from another subject <br>
                    to take the subjects, or whether it was open to anyone to try. There may have been a N.E.W.T. exam for these <br>
                    subjects too. <br>
                    <br>
                    Certain subjects could be abolished for certain reasons. Albus Dumbledore was originally planning to scrap <br>
                    Divination altogether due to its inaccuracy to most, but he kept the subject as a pretence to protect Sybill <br>
                    Trelawney from the Death Eaters. During the conquered Ministry's regime, Defence Against the Dark Arts was <br>
                    cancelled and replaced with outright Dark Arts, conforming with Lord Voldemort's reign of darkness. <br>
                    Upon the defeat of Voldemort, the Dark Arts class was abolished and the regular Defence class was restored. <br>
