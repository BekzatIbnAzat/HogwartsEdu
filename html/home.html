                <h3>Prof. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore</h3>
                <p>Considered the most powerful wizard in the world, <br>
                    Dumbledore is benevolent and wise, a good wizard in the style of Merlin.<br>
                    He exudes an aura of serenity and composure, rarely displaying intense 
                    emotions of anger or fear.<br> Yet despite his benign nature, it is said that 
                    Dumbledore is the only wizard <br>Lord Voldemort ever truly feared.<br>
                    Dumbledore is very eccentric and even slightly effeminate;<br> 
                    he is very fond of knitting patterns and <br>frequently wears flamboyant clothing 
                    (at one point, he is seen wearing a flowered bonnet).<br> 
                    He is also known for his odd displays of whimsicality;<br> 
                    he often uses humour to make people feel comfortable in his presence.<br> 
                    As a supremely talented wizard, Dumbledore displays numerous examples of 
                    extraordinary powers.<br> His abilities as a wizard are combined with a kind of 
                    cunning and subtlety of mind that <br>allowed him to comprehend human nature and 
                    turn the <br>better aspects of humanity (trust, love, and friendship) to Voldemort's 
                    disadvantage in particular.</p>
