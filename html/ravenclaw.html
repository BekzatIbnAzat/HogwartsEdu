            <h1>House Ravenclaw: Intelligence</h1>
            <p>Gaining entry to House Ravenclaw requires that one solve a logical riddle, meaning <br>
                only the sharpest of minds are fit for its hallowed halls. <br>
                <br>
                Founder Rowena Ravenclaw once said, “Wit beyond measure is man's greatest <br>
                treasure,” but in todays marketing environment, nothing is beyond measure! And <br>
                because of this, we have a treasure trove of data to inform and guide our strategies. <br>
                <br>
                You may not have a Sorting Hat to compartmentalize your audience, but you do <br>
                have access to many tools that can help develop accurate profiles and personas. Tap <br> 
                into demographics through LinkedIn and other sources. Research competitors to <br>
                see what theyre doing with their content -- then do it better. Set achievable and <br>
                tangible goals, and execute.
