            <h1>House Hufflepuff: Empathy</h1>
            <p>“Those Hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil.” Hard-working and loyal, the <br>
                members of this house are an admirable bunch. They are generally kind, <br>
                trustworthy, and non-contentious, leading some to associate them with a certain <br> 
                vanilla blandness. But do not take these vital qualities for granted, especially at a <br> 
                time where trust toward institutions is dreadfully low. <br>
                <br>
                Now more than ever, marketers must exert every effort to practice empathy and <br>
                build meaningful connections. Take on the customerss point of view and address <br>
                their pain points in a credible way. <br>
                <br>
                And while entry to the cozy Hufflepuff Basement requires a special procedure of <br>
                rhythmic barrel-tapping, yousll go a long way toward earning your audiences <br>
                affinity by removing barriers and offering ungated content.
