                        Astronomy was the only field of study at Hogwarts that had a direct equivalent 
                        in the Muggle world. Astronomy classes took place in the Astronomy Tower, 
                        the tallest tower in Hogwarts, and were taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra.

                        Charms were a type of spells concerned with giving an object new and 
                        unexpected properties, and hence this class mainly consisted of 
                        learning those sorts of spells. Charms classes were described 
                        as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons were largely 
                        practical.
