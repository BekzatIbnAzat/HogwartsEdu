                <h3>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</h3>
                <p>
                    Founded in the 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, <br>
                    Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin, Hogwarts was established in the Highlands <br>
                    of Scotland to educate young wizards and witches as well as to keep students safe from <br>
                    muggle persecution. Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw came up with the name of Hogwarts <br>
                    after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake. Since then, <br>
                    Hogwarts educated most wizarding children with residence in Great Britain and Ireland, <br>
                    keeping its location hidden from other wizarding schools and muggles. <br>
